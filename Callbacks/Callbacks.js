//////Callbacks

//Functions are objects, so they can be used the way we use other data types. We can do the following with functions:
/////1. pass it as a parameter into another function
/////2. store it in a variable, object, or array
/////3. return it from another function

///When we pass a function into another function as an argument, we are using a callback.

//1. In what types of situations would we want to use a callback function?
